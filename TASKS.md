# Work queue

States: Todo, In progress, Blocked (specific dependency), Done (with evidence).
Keep current work and a short completed baseline; avoid session logs.

| Task | Spec / criteria | State | Evidence or next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T001: Build starter | S001-AC01, AC02, AC04 | Done | Setup checks passed; web screen observed |
| T002: Confirm Android screen | S001-AC03 | Todo | User opens Expo Go and confirms the welcome screen |
| T003: Publish starter | S001-AC05 | Done | Remote matched starter commit c11eb6c |
| T004: Publish SDD documents | User's documentation request | In progress | Commit documents and verify the corresponding remote commit |
| T005: Specify first football feature | Next spec, not yet defined | Todo | Establish first user flow and measurable criteria before implementation |

New implementation tasks reference one spec, relevant acceptance IDs, and a concrete check.
Split work by observable behavior. Candidate ideas do not become authorized tasks automatically.
